# Short Answers

### What is source code?

- Source code is the code created by the developer, that will eventually be converted into machine code that the computer can understand.

---

### What makes computers so smart, anyways?

- Computers read code from top to bottom and follow instructions to the letter, and are made faster and "smarter" via chips, that have gotten smaller and faster over time.

---

### What is the purpose of a programming language?

- A programming language provides developers with specific methods with which to create functional code that can be understood by computers. Different languages are more efficient in different ways.

---

### 3 Examples of programming languages?

- Java, Python, and Javascript are three examples. There are so many languages because there are different pros and cons to programming, and you have to choose which is correct for the project you are trying to accomplish. an example of these pros and cons are memory, speed, and overall security.

---

### What is a variable? Why are they useful?

- A variable is a particular value that is stored in memory. These are useful because they can be altered and re-introduced whenever the developer needs them, which greatly improves efficiency and length of code.

---

### Difference between single = and double ==?

- Single = assigns a value to a variable while double == checks to see if something is equal to something else, returning a boolean.

---

### Difference between double == and triple ===?

- Double equals checks if two things are equal to one another, without checking for variable type, while triple === checks for the same thing while taking variable type into account. "4" === 4 would return false but "4" == 4 would return true.

---

### Why does the developer console exist?

- This exists to make testing code easier for the developer and helps make bugs and errors more apparent.

---

### What are conditional statements?

- Conditional statements are those that are either true or false, and, if true, continue to run the code inside the statement as a result. An example would be "If 5 > 4, say '5 is greater than 4'". In this case, "5 is greater than 4" would be printed.

---

### Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code?

- In case something needs to be repeated a set amount of times, or a multiple amount of times unknown to the developer at the time. 

---

### When would you use WHILE instead of FOR?

- You would do this when you don't know the specific number of times something should be occurring, but do know when it should stop.

---

### What is a function? Why should we use them?

- A function is a block of code that runs when it is called upon by the rest of the code. These are good to use because they consolidate code into easy-to-read sections, as well as prevent excessive reusing of code.

---

### How many values can you receive back from a function? How many can you send in?

- You can receive one value back, known as the `return` value. You can send in as many values as you need to make the code functional.

---

### What is an array?

- An array is a list of values bundled up into one variable so as to better consolidate values that are being used for similar purposes. It can hold as many values as needed, and in certain languages, its length can be altered after initialization.

---

### What is a T-diagram and why is it important?

- A T-diagram is a diagram where variables go on the left and their values go on the right. These help developers keep track of particularly complex code where variables are changing frequently.

---

### What are the two ways to comment JS code?

- // makes the rest of the line it is on a comment. /* and */ are bookend comments that you can use to create multiple-line comments.
